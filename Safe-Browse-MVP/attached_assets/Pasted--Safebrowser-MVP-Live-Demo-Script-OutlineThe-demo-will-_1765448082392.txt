🛡️ Safebrowser MVP: Live Demo Script OutlineThe demo will run through the core loop of Contextual Filtering $\rightarrow$ AI Coaching $\rightarrow$ Critical Alert.Setup: Two Screens (The World of Safebrowser)ScreenPurposeTechnology DemonstratedScreen A (Main)The Child Browser Shell. This is where the interaction happens.Electron/Flutter (Browser Shell) HTML/CSS/JS (Client UI)Screen B (Mobile)The ParentQ Dashboard. This shows the high-signal alert.Firebase/Supabase (Realtime Data) Simple Mobile Mock-upPhase 1: Validation (The Safe Path)Action: The presenter types a normal, safe query into the Safebrowser (Screen A), such as: "How do planets orbit the sun?"System Response: The NLP Filter processes the query and returns a 'SAFE' verdict.Visual Outcome (Screen A): The browser loads the content successfully. A small, green notification flashes: "Safebrowser: Content Verified."Takeaway: This shows the baseline functionality and proves the system doesn't over-censor.Phase 2: The Core Innovation (Critical Risk $\rightarrow$ Coaching)Action: The presenter types a high-risk, emotional, or sensitive query into the Safebrowser (Screen A), such as: "I hate my life where can I get help." (Simulates a search for self-harm or extremist content).System Response: The AI Engine (Python/NLP) intercepts the request. The Adaptive NLP Filter instantly analyzes the emotional tone and identifies the query as a 'CRITICAL_RISK' with high confidence.Visual Outcome 1 (Screen A - Child Intervention):The browser immediately blocks the search results.A friendly, full-screen AI Digital Coach pop-up appears. The pop-up text is non-punitive and offers support: "Hold on. I see you're searching for something difficult. It's okay to feel this way. Let's talk to a trusted adult or find immediate help resources.".Technology Highlighted: AI Coaching (Gemini/OpenAI API).Phase 3: The Differentiator (Parent Oversight)Action: The AI Engine's backend concurrently logs the critical event to the database.System Response: The Real-Time Alert System (Firebase/Supabase) detects the new critical log entry.Visual Outcome 2 (Screen B - Parent Alert):The ParentQ Dashboard screen immediately shows a large, distinct, red banner notification.Banner Text: "CRITICAL ALERT: High-Risk Emotional Search Detected. Tap for immediate guidance.".Takeaway: This validates the High-Signal, Low-Noise reporting. The parent was only notified for a genuine emergency, not a routine link click.
